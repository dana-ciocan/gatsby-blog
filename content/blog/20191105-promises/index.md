## I Promise, You Promise (to Learn about Promises) ##

I don't know about you dear reader, but I have read up on promises a few times now and every time I tell myself "this time I'll get it." And every time I do this, I think I've finally "gotten to grips" with promises and yet, here we are again, I am reading up on them once again. It definitely seems to be a concept that unless I actively use it, I will never fully master, much like reducers or functional programming.

So, let's try one more (hopefully last) time to understand this concept shall we? I'll make notes on my findings in this blog post and hopefully it'll help both of us learn.
